Fantastic Lamp
==============

Naming stuff is hard, so this name was generated by GitHub.

# Running

## Task #1 and #2
As it wasn't specified how to interact with the code written for tasks #1 and #2 I simply added tests which can be modified.

## Task #3
The webapi can be run with: `GO111MODULE=on go run main.go` from the commandline, or built with `GO111MODULE=on CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build`

## Task #4

The docker container can be built with:
```
docker build --force-rm -t fantastic-lamp .
docker run --publish 6060:8080 --name test --rm fantastic-lamp
```
